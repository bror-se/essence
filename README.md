# Essence Wordpress Theme

## Summary:

This is a barebones theme for Wordpress that's based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://www.html5boilerplate.com/). It's much similar to the [Roots Theme](http://www.rootstheme.com/) but without default styling and CSS frameworks.

* HTML5 ready. Use the new tags with certainty.
* Build script included. Use the build script out of the box. No Wordpress specific configurations needed!
* Normalized css that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
* No more ugly Wordpress URLs. URLs are relative and rewritten.
