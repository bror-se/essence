# Essence Wordpress Theme

Essence is a professional barebones theme for Wordpress that's based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://www.html5boilerplate.com/). It includes functions for cleaner HTML output and a build script to automate the minification and concatenation of your HTML/CSS/JS.

## Quick start

Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/kevva/essence.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/kevva/essence/zipball/master)

## Features

* HTML5 ready. Use the new elements with confidence.
* Cross-browser compatible (Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox 3.6+, IE6+).
* "Mobile first"/"Responsive design"-capable out of the box.
* Clean URLs (no more `/wp-content/`)
* All static theme assets are rewritten to the website root (`/css/`, `/img/`, and `/js/`)
* Apache server caching, compression, and other configuration defaults for Grade-A performance.
* Robots.txt optimized for SEO
